This is a project which contains two different projects: React Application and an NodeJS basic API (Contained on `api` folder)

## NodeJS API

Before run React App, we should follow next steps:

### 1.- Open new terminal and go to API directory
### 2.- Run `npm start` command

This should up Api which will serve endpoints and resources which will be consumed by React App.

### * IMPORTANT: If you close terminal which have API running, this will stop api and React App will not be able to consume resources from api project. To follow next steps, please open new terminal.

## React App

One we started API and everything is OK, we will go back to main folder and start the project with command `npm start`.
